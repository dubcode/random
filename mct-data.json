The influence of different filler components and firing temperatures on the ceramifiable properties of the composites was studied. The dripping behaviour of the composites was analyzed by a vertical burning test. The microstructure of the residues was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the optimised EVA composite was free of melt dripping during burning with the addition of OMMT. A dimensionally stable and dense ceramic residue was also obtained,  specially with the addition of WCRP. It was suggested that new phases were formed at firing temperatures, and WCRP could promote the formation of ceramic body which was not fused during firing at 900°C as evidenced by XRD."

Three different types of flame retardants were tested for synergistic effect: Mica (phlogopite) high aspect-ratio platelets, along with low softening point temperature glass frit (featuring ceramization effect), and melamine cyanurate, a commonly used flame retardant promoting carbonaceous char. In order to characterize the properties of the composites, combustibility, thermal stability, viscoelastic properties, micromorphology, and mechanical properties were tested before and after ceramization.

Adding CP and TPPMMT does not change the pyrolysis apart from increasing inorganic residue. The total heat evolved (THE) is changed insignificantly, as neither relevant additional carbonaceous charring nor flame inhibition occurs. However, flame retardancy is clearly observed due to an inorganic-carbonaceous surface protection layer. The peak heat released rate (PHRR) is reduced by around 32–42% when 5 wt% TPPMMT is added, and 51–63% when 10 wt% CP is added. PHRR reduction less than expected is observed when both additives are combined. The reduction is greater than that achieved by using TPPMMT but less than when only CP is used. The morphology of fire residue is investigated by scanning electron microscope on different length scales and turns out to be the key to understanding the efficiency of flame retardancy. The fire residue of EP/CP shows a layered structure, whereas separated columns limit the barrier properties for EP/ 5%TPPMMT on the micrometer scale. Columns dominating the fire residue structure of EP/5%TPPMMT/ 10%CP deteriorate the fire retardancy, whereas a more integral structure at the top of the residue causes the improvement over EP/5%TPPMMT."

The preferred ternary sulphate glass melts at 420~ and has the composition K2S04 9 NazS04  9 2ZnS04, which also corresponds to the composition of a congruently melting ternary compound. In a simple, tin-stabilized PVC compound, lOphr (parts per hundred of resin) resulted in a 54% reduction in smoke in the flaming mode of the NBS Smoke Chamber. 40phr gave a smoke reduction of 83%. The preferred ternary sulphate glass also works in concert with low levels of other known smoke retarders. For example, lOphr of the ternary glass and 5phr of MoO3 gave a smoke reduction of 78%, while 40phr of the glass and 5phr of MoO3 gave a smoke reduction of 93%. The addition of transition metal sulphates to low-melting compositions in the KzS04- Na2SO4-ZnS04 system led to the development of low-melting glasses and glass-ceramics containing Ni 2+, Cu 2§ and VO 2+. These transition metal modified sulphates were also very effective smoke retarders in the simple PVC compound. All of the low-melting\nsulphate glasses and glass-ceramics promoted intumescence and char formation during combustion of the simple PVC compound. In this way they effectively formed thermal barriers to retard further combustion. "

      "abstract": "Since the discovery of vulcanization, rubbers have invaded our life and nowadays occupie a significant place in the industrial world. In fact, in most applications there are no alternative materials to them. Despite what it could be thought, a rubbery object is a very complex system. In fact, it is generally based on only one or more rubbers and on several other additives, such as reinforcing fillers, plasticizers, antidegradants, vulcanizing agents. Different production phases are required to realized a rubbery product. The first is the rubber compounding with the additives, which occurs at a defined temperature for a fixed time. The dispersion degree achieved by the fillers in the elastomeric matrix and consequently the final product properties are strictly dependent on this first step of production. After the mixing, the forming operations follow: the compound will retain the shape imposed. Finally, vulcanization process provides the material its ‘elastic’ recovery behaviour. The final properties of a rubber product depend mainly on the type of rubber chosen, however they can be further manipulated by varying the additives used and their concentrations, and the processing steps. The special character of rubber, being a multicomponent system, and the complexity of the production phases delayed the study and the development of rubber nanocomposites, in respect to the polymeric ones. However, in the ten past years, the reports published that deal with rubber nanocomposites have been raise. The ongoing R&D interest is mostly due to the significant physico-mechanical properties improvement which is observed when the nanoclays are added to a rubber matrix. This enhancement depends on the nanometric-scale dispersion that the nanoclays can achieve in the compound; contrary to the conventional fillers, such as carbon black and silica, which carry out a micrometric-scale dispersion. Nowadays, the nanoclays are the most studied nano-sized fillers because there are easily available in nature and cheap. Several research works have demonstrated that the addition of even low amounts of layered nanofillers (< 10 wt.%) improves the mechanical properties, decreases gas permeability and swelling in solvents, increases thermal endurance and flame resistance."

      "abstract": "Ceramifiable ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) composites with fiber network structures were prepared by using aramid fiber (AF), ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and silicate glass frits (SGF). The effect of AF on the curing characteristic of the ceramifiable EPDM composites was studied. The morphology of AF in the composites system was observed by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effects of the observed AF network structures on the solvent resistance, mechanical properties, ablative resistance, self-supporting property, and ceramifiable properties of the composites were investigated. Results suggested that the existence of the AF network structure improved the vulcanization properties, solvent resistance, thermal stability, and ablative resistance of the EPDM composites. An excellent self-supporting property of the EPDM composites was obtained by combining the formation of the AF network and the formation of crystalline phases at higher temperature (above 600 °C). The thermal shrinkage performance of AF and the increased thermal stability of the EPDM composites improved the ceramifiable properties of the EPDM composites."

      "abstract": "Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) filled with glass dust (GD), glass fiber (GF), OMMT, and melamine cyanurate (MCA) was developed as a ceramifiable flame-retardant polymer composite for cables and insulated wires. The ceramics formed at different high temperatures based on the ceramifiable flame-retardant polymer composites were investigated by mechanical testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy the flame retardation of the ceramifiable flame-retardant EVA composites was studied with the aid of vertical burning testing (UL-94), limiting oxygen index (LOI), and cone calorimeter (CC) tests. The results showed that the ceramics were prepared successfully at different high temperatures based on the ceramifiable flame-retardant polymer composites. For the EVA/GD/GF/OMMT/MCA system with a weight ratio of 35/26/9/5/25, the ceramic formed at 800 C had a flexural strength of 13.82 MPa, and both a UL-94 V-0 rating and a LOI of 28.2% were achieved. Moreover, CC results confirmed that the heat release rate (HRR), total release rate (THR), smoke production rate (SPR), and mass loss rate (MLR) of the composite were reduced significantly compared with the corresponding value of neat EVA or the ceramifiable EVA composite without MCA. The dilatometric experiment analysis, SEM, and viscosity analysis demonstrated that a eutectic mixture resulting from GD and GF led to the formation of ceramics at high temperature. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TG), etc. illustrated that both the release of a large amount of non-flammable gas and the presence of OMMT led to the much better flame retardancy of EVA/GD/GF/OMMT/MCA than that of neat EVA or the ceramifiable EVA composites without MCA."

      "abstract": "Ceramifiable composites based on silicone rubber (SR) filled with mica powder, glass dust (GD) and short glass fiber (SGF) were successfully prepared for high-temperature applications. The effect of the GD/SGF phr ratio in the fluxing agents on the ceramifiable and mechanical properties of the silicone rubber composites was studied. The results demonstrated that the composites showed excellent properties when the ratio of GD/SGF was 1 : 1 and the corresponding tensile strength was 6.5 MPa. The elongation at break of the composites reached 245.4% and the flexural strength of sintered samples produced at 1000 C was 16.2 MPa. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicated that the char residue was 57.5% at 700 C, which was much higher than the virgin SR residue. The ceramization process at different sintering temperatures was consequently studied through infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The linear shrinkage and flexural strength of sintered samples increased with increasing sintering temperature from 600 to 1000 C. The FTIR and XRD tests indicated that the  luorophlogopite mica structure was destroyed and a new cristobalite crystalline phase was formed at elevated temperature. The SEM revealed that a coherent  nd dense microstructure of sintered samples was formed with increased temperatures, which contributed to the flexural strength improvement."
