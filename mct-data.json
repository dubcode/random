In fact, in most applications there are no alternative materials to them. Despite what it could be thought, a rubbery object is a very complex system. In fact, it is generally based on only one or more rubbers and on several other additives, such as reinforcing fillers, plasticizers, antidegradants, vulcanizing agents. Different production phases are required to realized a rubbery product. The first is the rubber compounding with the additives, which occurs at a defined temperature for a fixed time. The dispersion degree achieved by the fillers in the elastomeric matrix and consequently the final product properties are strictly dependent on this first step of production. After the mixing, the forming operations follow: the compound will retain the shape imposed. Finally, vulcanization process provides the material its \u2018elastic\u2019 recovery behaviour. The final properties of a rubber product depend mainly on the type of rubber chosen, however they can be further manipulated by varying the additives used and their concentrations, and the processing steps. The special character of rubber, being a multicomponent system, and the complexity of the production phases delayed the study and the development of rubber nanocomposites, in respect to the polymeric ones. However, in the ten past years, the reports published that deal with rubber nanocomposites have been raise. The ongoing R&D interest is mostly due to the significant physico-mechanical properties improvement which is observed when the nanoclays are added to a rubber matrix. This enhancement depends on the nanometric-scale dispersion that the nanoclays can achieve in the compound; contrary to the conventional fillers, such as carbon black and silica, which carry out a micrometric-scale dispersion. Nowadays, the nanoclays are the most studied nano-sized fillers because there are easily available in nature and cheap. Several research works have demonstrated that the addition of even low amounts of layered nanofillers (< 10 wt.%) improves the mechanical properties, decreases gas permeability and swelling in solvents, increases thermal endurance and flame resistance."}},{"id":265,"acf":{"dt":"Ceramifiable EVA\/APP\/SGF composites for improved ceramifiable properties","uid":"22","rt":"Journal Article","so":"Polymer Degradation and Stability","ye":"2018","su":"Low-melting point silcate glass with APP is studied in this well organised and well explained paper.
